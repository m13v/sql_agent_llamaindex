# Building an Agent around a Query Pipeline
This agent takes a natural language query from a user, generates an SQL query, and iteratively debugs it until the original question is answered.

Check out my video tutorial: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthew-diakonov-a84a1911_played-around-with-agent-in-a-loop-scenario-activity-7169113742746529792-gH9o?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

This notebook builds on the LlamaIndex documentation tutorial: https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/agent_runner/query_pipeline_agent.html. I encountered some dependency and deprecation issues when following the original tutorial, and I've attempted to fix them for a smoother experience.

If you liked it, please give it a star!  Let me know if you'd like to see more similar repos, drop me a message.
